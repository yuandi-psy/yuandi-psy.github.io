Abstract: One prominent theory in neuroscience and psychology assumes that cortical regions for language are left hemisphere
lateralized in the human brain. In the current study, we used a novel technique, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging
(qMRI), to examine interhemispheric asymmetries in language regions in terms of macromolecular tissue volume (MTV)
and quantitative longitudinal relaxation time (T1) maps in the living human brain. These two measures are known to
ref lect cortical myeloarchitecture from the microstructural perspective. One hundred and fifteen adults (55 male, 60 female)
were examined for their myeloarchitectonic asymmetries of language regions.We found that the cortical myeloarchitecture
of inferior frontal areas including the pars opercularis, pars triangularis, and pars orbitalis is left lateralized, while that of
the middle temporal gyrus, Heschlâ€™s gyrus, and planum temporale is right lateralized. Moreover, the leftward lateralization
of myelination structure is significantly correlated with language skills measured by phonemic and speech tone awareness.
This study reveals for the first time a mixed pattern of myeloarchitectonic asymmetries, which calls for a general theory to
accommodate the full complexity of principles underlying human hemispheric specialization.
