Hello! I am a Ph.D. Candidate working under the supervision of [Prof. Patrick Wong](http://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/patrickwong.php) at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://bmi.cuhk.edu.hk/). My research interests lie at the intersection of neuroscience and language development, specifically in the area of speech and language development in children with hearing loss. I am passionate about exploring the neural-behavioral relationship using neuroimaging methodologies to understand how the brain is modulated by the auditory experience, and how it can affect further language development in children with hearing loss. Through my research, I hope to shed light on the intricate workings of the human brain and to ultimately help improve the quality of life for children with hearing loss.

In addition to my work in speech and language development, I am also interested in studying social interactive behaviors. I use a novel technique called hyperscanning to record the neural activity from multiple brains simultaneously under natural social interactive conditions. This approach provides insights into the inter-brain mechanism of human social behaviors.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my website. Please feel free to explore my research and do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
